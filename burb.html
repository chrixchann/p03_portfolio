        <h1>BC Bud Culture</h1>
        <p>
          With this project, my group and I aimed to design a web experience
          that would bring “BC Bud” to the new world of legalized cannabis as
          well as offer a new, personalized e-commerce experience that would
          make legacy cannabis users more comfortable shopping online. Burb is a
          cannabis dispensary with a culture deeply rooted in “BC Bud”. “BC Bud”
          is synonymous around the world with high-quality cannabis from expert
          growers on the west coast over many decades, even before legalization.
        </p>
        <p class="comments">
          We knew we had to figure out how to get the message of "high quality
          cannabis is here", through e-commerce.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>
          My role in the research part of the project was to take a deep dive
          into what Burb is as a company. My perspective was that since “BC Bud”
          is such a deeply rooted part of Burb’s brand and culture, it would
          make a lot of sense if we could design something for the user’s who
          closely associate themselves with that too. With more and more people
          wanting to try cannabis, why not design something that can help those
          first-timers who don't want to visit an intimidating brick-and mortar
          cannabis shop.
        </p>

          It would make the most sense to design something for the customers who
          would need the most help online.

        <h1>Demograhic Research</h1>
        <p>
          I also did research on the demographics of the cannabis industry,
          looking for meaningful takeaways that would inform my design decisions
          centered around the users. And while business considerations were not
          required for the project, I did want to make sure that this process of
          designing something for a client would be realistic and applicable in
          the real world. I found here that the majority of cannabis users today
          are at the age where they likely would have been using cannabis before
          it was legalized. We will call these users, legacy cannabis users.

          cannabis market.

        <h3>Personalized Experience Flow</h3>
        <p>
          Our personalized shopping experience was designed to emulate the
          service you would get in Burb stores. When designing this feature I
          did research into what users may want out of their cannabis
          experience. Like whether they are using it to relax or re-energize,
          how they want to consume their cannabis, and what kind of feeling they
          want out of it. After considering all these factors, the feature would
          provide suggestions based on what the user wants.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          Looking back on this project, I'd say that the most valuable skill I
          gained from completing this project was how to conduct proper
          research. More specifically, knowing what to research in order to find
          information that is useful pushes me towards finding a good solution
          for the client. In this case, it was researching other successful
          brands and finding out what made their customers so loyal to them.
          <br /><br />
          Working together with my group members also went extremely well and I
          learned a lot about how to keep things organized in a self-directed
          group. Things like making a weekly timeline where we would each put
          down our availabilities made it easy to find times when we could all
          get together and make decisions on the direction of our project, and
          agreeing to leave egos out of our workspace made collaboration go
          extremely smoothly and ensured we always got the best ideas.
          <br /><br />
          While I am very proud of the work we did on creating an online
          shopping experience that made customers feel like they were making
          informed decisions, I do think we could have made the site look more
          visually comforting to more closely match Burb’s culture and mission.
