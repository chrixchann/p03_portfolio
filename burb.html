        <h1>BC Bud Culture</h1>
        <p>
          With this project, my group and I aimed to design a web experience
          that would bring ‚ÄúBC Bud‚Äù to the new world of legalized cannabis as
          well as offer a new, personalized e-commerce experience that would
          make legacy cannabis users more comfortable shopping online. Burb is a
          cannabis dispensary with a culture deeply rooted in ‚ÄúBC Bud‚Äù. ‚ÄúBC Bud‚Äù
          is synonymous around the world with high-quality cannabis from expert
          growers on the west coast over many decades, even before legalization.
        </p>
        <p class="comments">
          We knew we had to figure out how to get the message of "high quality
          cannabis is here", through e-commerce.

        <h1>Research [SPLIT THIS INTO COMPANY AND DEMOGRAPHIC]</h1>
        <p>
          My role in the research part of the project was to take a deep dive
          into what Burb is as a company. My perspective was that since ‚ÄúBC Bud‚Äù
          is such a deeply rooted part of Burb‚Äôs brand and culture, it would
          make a lot of sense if we could design something for the user‚Äôs who
          closely associate themselves with that too. With more and more people
          wanting to try cannabis, why not design something that can help those
          first-timers who don't want to visit an intimidating brick-and mortar
          cannabis shop.

          It would make the most sense to design something for the customers who
          would need the most help online.
