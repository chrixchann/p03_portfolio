        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The Prada Double Club Miami takes the cultural climate of two powerful
          human backdrops to embody a refreshing take on a universal experience.
          Showcasing the strong Caribbean and Western atmospheres that co-exist
          in Miami, artist Carsten Höller transcends art into a real and
          interactive nightclub. By juxtaposing two authentic and uncompromising
          environments with a permeable boundary, an unexplored third form
          arises.
        </p>
        <p class="comments">
          Create an exciting, inticing website for a pop-up nightclub, which had
          a theme that needed a little explaining.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>
          The design process began with finding and gathering information about
          the club, and since we found that it was a pop-up club that had been
          in other international cities as well, I thought we should do research
          into the city of Miami so we could differentiate it from other cities.
          As well as gathering inspiration from other websites and artists. We
          then came together and discussed what we thought were the most
          interesting and useful points about what we found and established some
          moodboards. I suggested that we create separate moodboards so that we
          would have more than one line of investigation to work on. Through our
          research, we found that the artist really wanted to present a lot of
          opposing ideas, so in our designs, we wanted to use a lot of
          duplication. We also did brainstorming about what would entice a
          person living in Miami to come to the Double Club. Miami is a city
          famous for its electric nightlife, so we wanted to provide a feel from
          our first points of contact that would make them think this is not
          your typical club.
        </p>
        <p class="comments">
          We had to figure out what the club was all about too.

        <p>
          Using our moodboards we began to come up with a visual direction that
          would attract Miamians to the club, and work well in the digital
          space. Each one of us took a moodboard and used our user brainstorming
          in an attempt to create graphical assets. We wanted to make sure we
          used the neon, saturated colours that Miami was often associated with,
          but also be sure to juxtapose it with simple design elements like
          lines and sans-serif fonts, just like the whole idea behind the Double
          Club. Our group worked very well as a team and was very open to
          collaboration, if we ever saw what someone else was doing and liked
          it, we encouraged each other to make a copy and experiment with the
          design.

        <h1>Final Posters</h1>
        <p>
          We landed on using these posters which I had created. They had a
          strong focus on typography and evoked a feeling of something hiding
          behind the type. The alternating direction of the type gives a rhythm
          to the poster. While the transparent type and ripped paper gives a
          unique texture and creates interesting figure-ground relationships
          between the image and type. When designing this poster, I wanted to
          viewers get a sneak peak of the monochromatic and polychromatic halves
          of the club. So I decided to “hide” the vibrant Miami colours behind a
          typical type-forward poster.

        <h1>Micro-site</h1>
        <p>
          With our finalized posters, we moved to using them as a baseline for
          our microsite design process. We tried implementing as much of the
          poster’s visual design direction into the microsite so they feel
          unified. The goal of the microsite is to introduce the users to a
          uniquely fascinating clubbing experience and entice them into buying a
          ticket for entrance to the club.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          This project was the first real “design” project that I had ever
          completed in my life and I am extremely proud of the work my group and
          I did. I learned so many new skills pertaining to user interface and
          user experience design including how to use laws of UX to create a
          user interface that is not only usable but fun to use. I also
          thoroughly learned how to use Figma and realized how powerful of a
          tool it is when it comes to wireframing and prototyping design ideas.
          <br /><br />
          However, I think the most valuable thing I gained from this project
          was the simulated experience of working for a client and managing
          tight deadlines. I’ll never forget the stressful times with my group
          members before our weekly project iterations were due, rushing to
          complete presentation decks and copywriting.
          <br /><br />
          If I were to return to this project in the future, I would have liked
          to do a more robust user research process that included user
          interviews with people who frequent clubs so I could create a more
          user experience more catered to the expected users, on the microsite.
